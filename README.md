The Liri Bot is an app that utilizes Javascript and Node.js and runs exclusively in the command line. Because of this please find below screenshots to better exemplify the app's functionality.

Once in the command line, the user can input one of four commands (after listing node liri.js): concert-this, spotify-this-song, movie-this, or do-what-it-says.

**if user user forgets to include a command, a default error message is displayed:



For concert-this, spotify-this-song, and movie-this: User can add additional input (artist name, song title, or movie name ,respectively) and it will be logged to the console, as well as be logged to the file called "log.txt"

concert-this (including user input)



**for spotify-this-song, and movie-this: If no user input is added, the command will run with default information

**for do-what-it-says: the result is determined by the information in the "random.txt" file.
